        <p>Hi, I'm Jo√£o!</p>
        <p>I'm a web developer based in Porto, Portugal.</p>
        <p>From early on, I had a special interest and curiosity about tech, that motivated me to learn some stuff on my own. My formal education is on graphic design and multimedia, so front-end always came easy to me.</p>
        <p>As both web developer and designer, my passion is for making good looking web apps, that not only work, but feel good to use.</p>
        <p>At the moment, I'm working at 327 Creative Studio, a design studio based in Porto, where we focus on creating great brands.</p>
        <p>I still make some stuff on my own from time to time, so if you have a great idea for a project, send me an email. I'm always available to give you a feedback and work together to make something awsome.</p>
